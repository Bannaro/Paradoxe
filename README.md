# Paradoxe

## What is it?

Paradoxe is a multiplatform video, chat application. It's similar to Skype but for you web browser, we also have a desktop apllication you can download. We host the web app at [Paradoxe.io](https://paradoxe.io), any code that is added to this repo will be deployed to the server in the next version.

## The vision

We want to develop a platform, where the users control the code that goes into the way they communicate and we make it available for them to use.

## Built with

The application was built with Meteor, React, Redux, Electron and a lot of NPM packages. 

## Docker image

**Comming soon**. We want to create a docker image that you can install on your server and host a private version of the application.
